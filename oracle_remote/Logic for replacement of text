    Logic:
    Send in a string, this string is the start
    Each new strign is appended to the end.
    
    1) Where to start?
    - Start at the end, because that acts as the base case
    - Build backwards.
    - Ex : <any recalls> and <all recalls>
    - This is then sent with the previous key, so it becomes 
        - <cases about this ...> + <any recalls>
        - <cases about this ...> + <all recalls>
    - The problem here is trying to return X amount of strings, where X is the number of options for pos i and pos i-1 (i starting from the left)
    - We can do something like taking an array [str1, str2 ... strX] from each backward iteration
    - Generate new sentences [nStr1, nStr2, ...nStrX] per Str from the options we have
    - this would generate a new list [nStr11, nStr12, nStr13, nStr21, nStr22 ... nStrYX]
    - This would be passed back and built on
    - Final list would consist of all possible iterations.    
    
    So steps are:
    1. Take the list of sentences available
    2. Look at my options
    3. Append my options to the _front_ of those lists
    4. Return the list.
    
    - Needed: 
    a. the sentences available
    b. my current options
