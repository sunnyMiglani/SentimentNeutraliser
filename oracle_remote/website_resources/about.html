      This page will tell you about Sentimentally!
    </h1>

    <p>
      Sentimentally is an autocorrect tool focused on sentiment!
      <br/>
      Given a sentence with some sentiment value in it, the algorithm and system being applied will
      find and replace these words with alternative words that change the overall sentiment of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see some examples of this <a href="/view-all"> here!</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal with this project in general is 
        <ul>
            <li> Allow users to pick a sentiment of their choosing (+ve, -ve, neutral)</li>
            <li> Suggest alterations in the words where the alterations hopefully match the Parts-Of-Speech of the sentence </li>
            <li> Currently it only changes words, but does not add or remove any words</li>
            <li> Currently the program gives you all possible alterations, not allowing users to pick a sentiment value!</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
